## 1.0 Information We Collect
Soosee does not collect anything. Soosee does not send any data from or to your device. All functionality is performed on your device. There are no network calls and no analytics. If we add this in the future we will let you know, but even then it would be hosted on our own servers with no tracking.

### 1.2 Information you provide to us 
In a future version of the app it will be possible to share your own groups with other people, but you will always need to initiate this sharing yourself and you will be given a clear warning.
